# Machine Learning : Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning

## Theoretical Machine Learning
We will cover the machine learning methods and models which are used to adress the ml problems like repression, classification and clustering etc tasks and also study the properities of these methods and models and have a proper understanding of when and where and for which problem we should use a specific method or model.
-  Understanding of machine learning algorithms - model, objective or loss function, optimization algorithm and evaluation criteria.
- Parameter tuning of  machine learning algorithms based on the outcome of experiments - what steps to take in case of underfitting and overfitting and to improve the performance of the model on the unseen dataset i.e model will befome generalized well.
- Develope proper understanding of  choosing among multiple algorithms for a given task.
- How and where to use the unsupervised learning techniques, we have to develop proper understanding of it.
